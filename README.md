# Robotics Audit Notes

This repository contains my self-directed notes from auditing advanced robotics courses from top universities.  
I am using this as part of my preparation for graduate study in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

## 📚 Courses Covered
- **Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control** (Northwestern University)
- **Control of Mobile Robots** (Georgia Tech)
- **Robotics Specialization** (University of Pennsylvania, GRASP Lab)
- **Robotics: Estimation and Learning** (ETH Zürich)

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in kinematics, dynamics, motion planning, and control
- Explore probabilistic robotics, perception-driven autonomy, and intelligent systems
- Demonstrate continuous self-learning through structured documentation

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `modern-robotics/` → Notes from Northwestern’s Modern Robotics course
- `control-of-mobile-robots/` → Notes from Georgia Tech’s course
- `robotics-specialization-upenn/` → Notes from UPenn’s specialization
- `estimation-and-learning-eth/` → Notes from ETH Zürich’s lectures

## 🛠 How I’m Using This Repo
- Each folder contains markdown (`.md`) notes organized by lecture/module
- I update after each lecture with summaries, formulas, and key takeaways
- This serves both as my personal knowledge base and a public learning trail
